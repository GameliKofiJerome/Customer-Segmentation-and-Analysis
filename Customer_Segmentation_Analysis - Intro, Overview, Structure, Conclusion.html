<h2 id="introduction-">Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this project, I employ Python data libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly) and the K-Means clustering algorithm to wrangle retail data, perform exploratory data analysis(EDA) and undertake a customer segmentation analysis using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to understand and unravel the intricacies of customer behaviour on a UK based and registered non-store online retail platform.</p>
<h2 id="dataset-overview">Dataset Overview</h2>
<p>The dataset used for this project encompasses a diverse array of more than 500K transactions, capturing the interactions of customers with the online retail platform. Features such as transaction dates, purchase amounts, and customer identifiers form the foundation for a comprehensive exploration of customer dynamics.
The following is a description of the columns that make up the dataset. For each data record, there are 8 variables.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>InvoiceNo</strong>: This is a 6-digit integer number, uniquely assigned to each transaction.
If the code starts with a &#39;C&#39;, it indicates a cancelled transaction.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>stockCode</strong>: This is a 5-digit integer number uniquely assigned to a distinct product on the online retail store.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Description</strong>: Product(item) name.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Quantity</strong>: The count or quantities of each product(item) per transaction.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>InvoiceDate</strong>: Invoice date and time. Day and time when each transaction was generated.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>UnitPrice</strong>: Product price per unit in pound sterling.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>CustomerID</strong>: 5-digit number uniquely assigned to each customer.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Country</strong>: Country where each customer resides.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h2>
<p>This project comprises three stages:</p>
<h3 id="1-stage-one-data-wrangling-cleaning-preparation-">1. Stage One: Data Wrangling (Cleaning &amp; Preparation)</h3>
<p>This is the first stage of the project where I focus on cleaning and preparing the data from a UK-based and registered non-store online retail for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) stage and to undertake Customer Segmentation and Analysis. In this stage of the project, I undertake the following tasks;</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing duplicate values and entries</li>
<li>Removing all null values</li>
<li>Correcting column data types</li>
<li>Correcting data anomalies</li>
<li>Formatting data values</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> In this stage, comments have been included in each code cell to guide users and viewers through the data-wrangling process.</p>
<h3 id="2-stage-two-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-">2. Stage Two: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
<p>This is the second stage of the project where I delve into the cleaned sales data from the data wrangling stage to explore and understand the key aspects of the data. I use interactive visualizations to communicate key insights and trends, as well as summary statistics to highlight key aspects of the dataset, helping stakeholders understand the nature of the data.
By answering questions on the data, I derive some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These key questions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>What proportion of transactions were captured as either <code>sale</code> or <code>canceled</code>?</li>
<li>What was the trend in transactions made over the recorded period?</li>
<li>From which countries were the most or least transactions recorded with respect to transaction type (sale or canceled)?</li>
<li>During which time of day (morning, afternoon, evening) were transactions made?</li>
<li>From which country did the online retail store have the most or least customers?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For each of the above questions, the key insights derived are found below each chart used to visualize the dataset result that explains the findings.</strong></p>
<h3 id="3-stage-three-rfm-recency-frequency-monetary-analysis">3. Stage Three: RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis</h3>
<p>In this final stage of the customer segmentation &amp; analysis project, I delved into the dataset(cleaned) of the online retail store to unravel the intricacies of customer behaviour. By leveraging the K-Means Clustering algorithm and the powerful RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, I aimed to distil valuable insights that could profoundly impact business strategies and enhance customer-centric decision-making.
The dataset encompasses a diverse array of almost 400K transactions, capturing the interactions of customers on the online retail platform. Features such as transaction dates(InvoiceDate), purchase amounts(UnitPrice), product quantity, stock code and customer identifiers form the foundation for a comprehensive exploration of customer dynamics.
The following are the objectives for this stage of the project:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Segmentation for Potential Targeted Marketing:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can customers be categorized into distinct segments based on their recency, frequency, and monetary contributions?</li>
<li>What insights can these segments provide to guide marketing strategies for improved customer engagements?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Identifying High-Value Customers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we identify or pinpoint high-value customers who contribute significantly to the business&#39;s revenue?</li>
<li>What patterns in recency, frequency, and monetary metrics characterize these high-value customers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Understanding the correlation between RFM metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do recency and purchasing frequency affect the monetary contributions of each customer segment?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Customizing Communication Strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can communication strategies be customized for different customer segments to enhance the overall customer experience</li>
<li>What personalized approaches can be adopted based on the identified RFM segments?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
